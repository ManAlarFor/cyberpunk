One of the most important events was the fall of the old internet, as it had such a huge quantity of malware and privacy control that one only man created a "wall" preventing people from entering it.</p>
                    <p>The world domination is shared between some macro-corporations, such as Arasaka(japanese), Militech(American) having both corporations a power struggle and even wars.</p>
