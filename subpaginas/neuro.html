                    <p>William Ford Gibson, born in Conway, South Carolina, grew up in an catholic environment which he didn't want to take part in, so he started reading and listening to music as a way to scape from reality. His book, "The Neuromant", was the precursor of the Cyberpunk genre, even popularizing the term cyberspace. He wrote several other cyberpunk books, but the most recent books he has published are in other based in other genres, but they are always technology related.</p>
